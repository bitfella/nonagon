          Playlist danceability
        </About__AboutSubHeading>
        <p>
          Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0% is least danceable and 100% is most danceable.

          Playlist energy
        </About__AboutSubHeading>
        <p>
          Energy is a measure from 0% to 100% and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.

          Playlist valence
        </About__AboutSubHeading>
        <p>
          A measure from 0% to 100% describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

          Nonagon is a client side web application: it does not have any backend and it relies totally on Spotify Web Apis to get data. It does not save your personal data wherever, altough it does save playlist on your Spotify account.

        <p>
          Nonagon makes use of the following Spotify authorization scopes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li
            key="0"
          >
            user-top-read
          </li>
          <li
            key="1"
          >
            playlist-modify-public
          </li>
          <li
            key="2"

          Nonagon just saves a Spotify authorization token and some of your app preferences on local storage: this is mandatory to make the app work. You can easily delete them clearing your browser data.
