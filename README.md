# Nonagon

[Nonagon](https://www.nonagon.app) is a single page React/Redux application whose purpose is the creation of Spotify playlists based upon user's personal tastes. This project was bootstrapped through [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev).

## Installation

Clone this repo and then launch the following:

    $ yarn

in your terminal to install all the required dependencies.

## Local development

A couple of environment variables are required to make the app work; save in an .env file in the root of the project `REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `REACT_APP_SENTRY_DSN` (if you don't care about Sentry just comment out that part in the source code), then launch:

    $ yarn start
